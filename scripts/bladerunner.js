Runs ahand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leanscloser and peers through the glass.Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SANANGELES, THREE MINUTES.The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckarddisembarks ahead of the other passengers and into thesweltering night.Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, hisshirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollowpassage under orbs of yellow light.Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.

Deckard stands out-side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the suddendownpour.A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous ironbalconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and otherlower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,cramped and darkly alive.Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through thecrowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a gratingas two old men, clad in towels descend a flight ofstairs under a neon sign that says bath house.A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes ashe turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a doorthat says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's openedby an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed tohis hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some wordswhich are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over andshuts the door.The companion ways below deck of a big ship are nomore bewildering than the ups and downs and ins andouts of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the doorhe's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, thenknocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gunopens it.An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps inand stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For aplace surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisinglyclean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotlessbasin is perfectly folded.Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  Helooks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looksunder it, then runs his hands along both sides of themattress.The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takesout what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-lessness, he lifts off the lid.It contains a little stack of photos bound with arubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lampby the balcony window and turns it on.A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind ofanonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in thesun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The fadedpolaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures ofsimple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curiouscollection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studiesthem with interest.Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino standsin the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowerslooking like he'd never been touched by the light ofday.Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearinghis coveralls, but he looks different.  His face ismore intent, smarter and angry.For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mashsomething, but suddenly he swings away and disappearsinto the crowd.Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from thewindow.Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs tomatch, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he coulddo it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alleybehind him and he's not out of breath.Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out ontoa narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter andsmall tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over theirfuming bowls jabbering and slurping.The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TVannouncer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beautyin a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashesa beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.",

As his foottouches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shattersthe air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a younggirl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLYSTOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from hislaser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,descends the basement stairs.At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OFMACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.Each door is fitted with a small window.

Pris' legs snap up,crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around hisneck.Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn'tnotice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending bloodto the brain.

Dead.He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rollsover and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  Itmight not sound like a war cry, but it is.Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doorsand walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks hisloads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shootthe next thing that moves and find out later if he wasright or wrong.On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyesmove down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.None.  He continues up the stairs.On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down thehall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  Ifsomebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.He kicks the door open and dives through head firstand hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into thefar corners of the room but the room is empty.  There'sa kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, bothclosed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  Noresponse from either door.Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenlyDeckard twists around and FIRES several shots into thecloset.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her handout like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid ofit.

Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceilinggives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit thecouch where he was sitting.

AsDeckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of therailing.Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basementfloor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almostfour hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard'sfingers are starting to slip.His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel overBatty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everythinghe's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  Thethumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, butDeckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over theleft.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-hand grip.Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can'tbe done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot overthe edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himselfonto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowlyclenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it'shis burning cheek against the cool metal he's most awareof.Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting onefoot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out intothe morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky hasbegun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn notvery pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckardis glad to see it.For a moment he tilts his head back and takes somebreath, then walks across the courtyard towards thestreet, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy tofall.Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-lapses on the front seat.In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on achair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.

Her lips are parted, herwarm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Lookinglithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, shestands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist onknowing.Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  Hisgaunt face, empty of expression except for the tearsrunning down his pale cheeks.But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crustedsnow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into thesilence of the freezing white landscape.Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along likesome metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of thelong, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silenceastounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-ing straight ahead.",
